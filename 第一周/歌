//Your
//manager receives a commission equal to 12% of the total sales revenue for
//your song, and the Internet site that lists your song receives a 3% commission. Write a java program that asks the user for the title of the song, the purchase
//price of the song (in dollars and cents), and the number of copies of the song
//that have been sold. Calculate the total revenue generated by your song, the
//commission received by your manager, and the commission received by the
//Internet site.
